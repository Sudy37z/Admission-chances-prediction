Hello, 
Myself Sudhanshu Thakur,
This is my second machine learning project, it is based on regression.
The topic which I have selected is, predicting the chance of admission of a student on the basis of GRE score,
LOR, SOP, University ranking , etc.

*********
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
It was already clean and did not have any null or garbage values or any outliers(can be seen from the box plot). 

********
I have applied Multiple linear regression model, Polynomial Linear regression model ,Random forest model, and Support vector regression model.
The accuracy has been measured by various parameters such as Mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error,R2 score and mean absolute percentage error.              
The highest accuracy was found to be 78% from multiple linear regression and the MAPE was 6.7%.
*******

No tuning was performed on any model.

Will surely update it after tuning(HAVE TO LEARN).

THANK YOU :)
